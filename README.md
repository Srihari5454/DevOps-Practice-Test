🧾 #Project Overview: Automated-Backss

The Automated-Backss project is a simple yet powerful automated backup system built using Bash scripting.
It automates the process of backing up important files or directories, organizing them by date, and logging each backup activity.
This project helps ensure data safety and reliability by automatically creating backups without requiring manual intervention.

It reflects real-world DevOps automation practices, combining concepts of scripting, logging, and structured file management.

🎯 Project Purpose

The main goal of this project is to:

Automate data backups at regular intervals (daily, weekly, monthly).

Keep data organized in a structured and easy-to-recover format.

Maintain logs for transparency and troubleshooting.

Allow quick restoration of previous backups.

Provide customizable configuration through a separate settings file.

By doing so, the system ensures that critical files are protected and recovery can be performed effortlessly.

🏗️ Project Folder Structure

The project follows a clean and modular structure, where each folder serves a distinct purpose.

Folder/File	Purpose	Example Content
bin/	Contains executable Bash scripts used to run the backup process.	backup.sh
config/	Holds configuration files that define backup settings.	backup.config
backups/	Stores all backup archives, organized by type (daily, weekly, monthly).	.tar.gz backup files
logs/	Contains log files that record backup activities, timestamps, and errors.	backup.log
restore/	Serves as the location where backups can be restored or extracted.	recovered files
.gitignore	Tells Git which files and folders to ignore (e.g., backups, logs).	.tar.gz, *.log
README.md	Project documentation explaining setup, usage, and structure.	—
⚙️ Main Components Explained
1. bin/backup.sh

This is the core script that performs all the main tasks.
It:

Reads configuration values from backup.config.

Checks if the source directory exists.

Creates folders for daily, weekly, and monthly backups.

Compresses the source directory into a .tar.gz archive with a timestamp.

Saves it under the correct backup folder (daily/weekly/monthly).

Logs each activity (success, failure, or missing files).

This is the heart of the project — it does the automation work.

2. config/backup.config

A configuration file that stores user-defined settings like:

Which folder to back up

Where to store backups

Log file paths

Backup schedule or frequency

This makes the script flexible — instead of hardcoding values, users can edit the config file.

3. backups/

All generated backup archives are stored here.
It may contain subfolders like:

daily/ → backups made every day

weekly/ → backups created every week

monthly/ → backups taken at the start of each month

Each backup is timestamped to make identification easier.

4. logs/

This folder stores the log file generated by the backup process.
Example:
backup.log records details such as:

Date and time of the backup

Which directory was backed up

Where it was stored

Whether it succeeded or failed

Logs are useful for auditing and debugging backup issues.

5. restore/

This directory is used for restoring files from backup archives.
When the user runs the script with a restore option, the selected backup file gets extracted here.

6. .gitignore

Ensures that large or unnecessary files (like backups and logs) are not uploaded to GitHub.
This keeps the repository lightweight and clean.

7. README.md

Contains a clear explanation of the project — including its purpose, folder structure, setup instructions, and usage examples.
This helps others understand and use your project easily.

🔄 How the Automation Works

Initialization – The script loads all paths and settings from the backup.config file.

Validation – It checks whether the source folder exists and if necessary directories are available.

Backup Creation – The script compresses the source directory into a .tar.gz file and places it under the appropriate folder (daily/weekly/monthly).

Logging – Every step (success, failure, or skipped file) is recorded in backup.log.

Restoration (Optional) – If the user specifies a restore command, the backup is extracted back into the restore directory.
